## Approved Decisions Summary

### Content Decisions
- [x] **Opening line:** "A quiet room for women who are ready to begin again."
- [x] **Photography:** Text-forward with subtle abstract imagery (linen textures, soft shadows, natural materials) — reserve space for future portraits
- [x] **Wordmark:** Typographic lockup (editorial serif) — horizontal, stacked, and abbreviated (EH) for favicon
- [x] **Host visibility:** Minimal — convener, not hero (one-line bio + reserved portrait)

### Registration Form (Approved Fields)
- [x] Full name (required)
- [x] Email (required)
- [x] "What brings you to this gathering?" (optional, short answer)

- [x] Email consent checkbox (required)

### Post-Registration Journey
- [x] Confirmation email (invitation tone, not transactional)
- [x] Pre-event email (7–10 days before) with logistics + tone-setting
- [x] Optional gentle reminder (48 hours before)

### Technical
- [x] **Domain:** TBD — architecture domain-agnostic
- [x] **Event:** February 28, 2026 — Millennium Airport Hotel, Dubai — 2:00 PM prompt
- [x] **Capacity:** Soft cap with curated RSVP system (waitlist + manual approval)

## Quality Commitment

This website will not feel like:

- ❌ A "nice website"

It will feel like:
- ✅ A quietly powerful invitation
- ✅ A space someone wants to step into
- ✅ A brand with depth, restraint, and intention

## Content Still Needed for Build

The following copy must be written before relevant sections can be finalized:

| Content | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Event description (2-3 paragraphs) | ⏳ Needed | Invitational, not promotional |
| "What happens" section | ⏳ Needed | 3-4 poetic statements |
| "Who this is for" section | ⏳ Needed | Psychographic, not demographic |
| Elysian House philosophy | ⏳ Needed | Manifesto tone |
| Host bio (1-2 sentences) | ⏳ Needed | Warm, not CV |
| Confirmation message copy | ⏳ Needed | Letter tone |

*These can be written collaboratively during implementation.*
