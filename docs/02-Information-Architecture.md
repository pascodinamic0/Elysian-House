## 2. Page Hierarchy & Purpose

### Tier 1: Home (/)
**Purpose:** Emotional entry point. The threshold.

**User arrives and should feel:**
- Immediate visual calm
- Recognized ("they understand something about me")
- Curious to continue

**Content priority:**
1. Opening statement (the hook that names her experience)
2. The invitation (what this gathering is)
3. The essence (what happens, without over-explaining)
4. The call (request your invitation)
5. The house (brief intro to Elysian House as ongoing)

**This page must:**
- Function as a complete experience (many users won't navigate further)
- Be scrollable as a single narrative
- Lead naturally to registration without pressure

---

### Tier 2: The Gathering (/gathering)
**Purpose:** Practical depth for those who need more before deciding.

**User arrives and should feel:**
- Clarity without overwhelm
- Trust that this is real and thoughtfully planned
- Confidence that this is not a sales event

**Content priority:**
1. What the gathering is (and isn't)
2. What happens (format, flow, facilitation)
3. Who it's for (psychographic, not demographic)
4. Practical details (date, location, duration, free)
5. Registration CTA

**This page must:**
- Answer practical questions without becoming FAQ-like
- Maintain emotional resonance from homepage
- Feel like a continuation, not a departure

---

### Tier 2: The House (/about)
**Purpose:** Brand depth for those curious about what's behind this.

**User arrives and should feel:**
- Connection to a philosophy, not just an event
- Sense that this is the beginning of something larger
- Trust in the intention behind the brand

**Content priority:**
1. What Elysian House is (the symbolic house)
2. Why it exists (origin, not origin story theater)
3. The host (brief, human, not guru-positioned)
4. The vision (what's coming)

**This page must:**
- Establish brand longevity
- Not center the founder excessively
- Feel like a manifesto, not an About Us

---

### Tier 3: Register (/register)
**Purpose:** Frictionless conversion for those ready to commit.

**User arrives and should feel:**
- No second-guessing ("did I miss something?")
- Privacy and safety
- That this is an invitation being accepted, not a transaction

**Content priority:**
1. Brief reaffirmation of what they're joining
2. Simple form (name, email, optional context)
3. Clear expectation of what happens next
4. Confirmation state with warmth

**This page must:**
- Load fast
- Work perfectly on mobile
- Feel like the final step of a conversation, not a checkout

---

## 3. Navigation Philosophy

### Primary Navigation
Minimal. Three items maximum.

```
[Elysian House]          [The Gathering]  [Request Invitation]
```

- Logo/wordmark links home
- "The Gathering" for those needing detail
- Primary CTA always visible but not aggressive

### Secondary Navigation (Footer)
- About / The House
- Instagram link
- Email/contact (minimal)
- Privacy (legal requirement, low prominence)

### Mobile Navigation
- Hamburger avoided if possible
- Sticky subtle CTA at bottom of scroll
- Same three-item structure

| Home | Opening hook + Invitation | Event essence | Brand intro |
| Gathering | What & who | Format & flow | Logistics |
| About | Philosophy | Host | Vision |
| Register | Form | Reassurance | Confirmation |

---

## 5. User Flows

### Flow A: High Intent (Instagram → Register)
```
Instagram → Home → Scroll → Register CTA → /register → Confirm
```
*Time: 2-3 minutes*

### Flow B: Curious Explorer
```
Instagram → Home → Scroll → The Gathering → Read → Register
```
*Time: 4-5 minutes*

### Flow C: Brand-Curious

```

### Flow D: Not Ready

```
*The site must be memorable enough to return to*
