# Design Guardrails
## Elysian House — Hard Constraints

---

## Purpose

This document defines absolute boundaries. These are not guidelines — they are rules. If a design decision violates any of these, it must be reconsidered or rejected.

The purpose is to protect the quality bar and ensure the final result feels premium, intentional, and distinctly *not* like everything else.

---

## 1. Structural Prohibitions

### ❌ NO Generic Hero Sections
- No "big image + headline + subhead + button" pattern
- No video backgrounds
- No animated text reveals that spell out words letter by letter
- No "scroll down" arrows bouncing

**Instead:** The opening is typographic, breathing, unhurried. The first impression is a statement, not a billboard.

---

### ❌ NO Overused Visual Treatments
- No gradient backgrounds (linear, radial, mesh)
- No glassmorphism
- No neumorphism
- No blob shapes
- No floating particles or confetti
- No parallax that makes the user seasick

**Instead:** Flat colors, subtle texture, restraint. Let content create visual interest.

---

### ❌ NO Testimonial Theater
- No carousel of testimonials
- No grid of quotes with headshots
- No star ratings
- No "What our attendees say" sections

**If testimonials exist:** Maximum one line, anonymized, poetic, integrated into narrative — not a "social proof" block.

**If they don't exist:** Omit entirely. Absence is more premium than fabrication.

---

### ❌ NO Cluttered CTAs
- No multiple CTAs competing for attention
- No sticky bars with "Register Now"
- No floating buttons
- No exit-intent popups
- No countdown timers
- No "Only X spots left!" urgency

**Instead:** One clear primary action per viewport. Let the content create desire. The CTA is an invitation, not a sales close.

---

### ❌ NO Marketing Copy Blocks
- No bullet points listing "what you'll get"
- No "Imagine..." statements
- No "In this gathering, you will..." lists
- No "This is for you if..." checklists
- No "This is NOT for you if..." exclusion lists
- No "transformation guarantees"

**Instead:** Narrative prose that speaks like a letter. Show, don't list. Invite, don't sell.

---

## 2. Copy Prohibitions

### ❌ NO Aggressive Language
- No "Limited time"
- No "Don't miss out"
- No "Act now"
- No "Secure your spot"
- No "Life-changing"
- No "Unlock your potential"
- No "Step into your power"

**Instead:** Invitational language. "You're welcome here." "Request your invitation." "A room for women ready to bloom."

---

### ❌ NO Diagnostic Tone
- No "If you're struggling with..."
- No "Do you feel stuck?"
- No "Are you tired of..."
- No "Most women experience..."

**Instead:** First-person narrative. "There's a season when..." "I built this room because..." "We gather."

---

### ❌ NO Empty Promises
- No "You WILL be transformed"
- No "Leave completely changed"
- No outcome guarantees
- No implied results

**Instead:** Descriptive, not prescriptive. Describe what the gathering is, not what it will do to you.

---

### ❌ NO Spiritual Clichés
- No "sacred space"
- No "divine feminine"
- No "align with your purpose"
- No "manifest"
- No "high vibe"
- No "energy"
- No "tribe"

**Instead:** Grounded, relatable language. "Witness." "Breathe." "Belong." "Become."

---

## 3. Visual Prohibitions

### ❌ NO Stock Photography
- No staged diversity shots
- No women laughing together
- No hands-in-air empowerment poses
- No candles, crystals, journals with pens
- No overly styled "Instagram" aesthetics
- No corporate headshots

**Instead:** Editorial photography with natural light, quiet moments, imperfection, atmosphere over action.

---

### ❌ NO Visual Noise
- No more than 3-4 colors on screen at once
- No competing focal points
- No dense content blocks
- No visual "busy-ness"
- No icons as decoration
- No borders around everything

**Instead:** One clear hierarchy. Generous space. Let the eye rest.

---

### ❌ NO Trendy Design Moves
- No "bento grid" layouts
- No 3D illustrations
- No AI-generated imagery
- No animated underlines that follow the cursor
- No magnetic buttons
- No scroll-triggered zoom effects
- No split-screen reveals

**Instead:** Timeless over trendy. Classic editorial layouts. Confidence in simplicity.

---

## 4. Technical Prohibitions

### ❌ NO Dark Patterns
- No hiding information to force registration
- No pre-checked marketing consent
- No misleading button copy
- No artificial scarcity
- No email required to see basic info

**Instead:** Full transparency. Content is available. Registration is optional and simple.

---

### ❌ NO Performance Compromises
- No page load over 3 seconds
- No layout shift after load
- No third-party scripts that block rendering
- No heavy animation libraries for simple effects
- No unoptimized images

**Instead:** Performance is a feature. Fast, smooth, respectful of the user's time and device.

---

### ❌ NO Accessibility Failures
- No text over busy images without sufficient contrast
- No color as the only indicator of state
- No keyboard traps
- No motion without reduced-motion respect
- No missing alt text
- No form fields without labels

**Instead:** WCAG AA compliance minimum. Accessibility is not optional.

---

## 5. Pattern Blacklist

The following patterns are explicitly forbidden, regardless of how "well-designed" they might be:

| Pattern | Why It's Banned |
|---------|-----------------|
| Floating chat widget | Feels transactional and intrusive |
| Cookie consent modal (oversized) | First impression ruined |
| Newsletter popup | Desperate, interrupting |
| Sticky header (aggressive) | Crowds the content |
| Hamburger menu (desktop) | Lazy, reduces navigation |
| Carousel/slider | User loses control |
| Auto-playing video | Hostile to user agency |
| "As seen in" logo bar | Credibility theater |
| Social sharing buttons | Noise, rarely used |
| Related posts/events | Distraction from focus |
| Back-to-top button (floating) | Visual noise |
| Progress bar on scroll | Unnecessary gamification |

---

## 6. Emotional Guardrails

### The site must NEVER feel:
- Desperate
- Loud
- Busy
- Corporate
- Cheap
- Trendy
- Manipulative
- Performative
- Generic

### The site must ALWAYS feel:
- Quiet
- Confident
- Warm
- Intentional
- Editorial
- Premium
- Invitational
- Human
- Trustworthy

---

## 7. Quality Checkpoints

Before any section is considered complete, it must pass these tests:

### The 5-Second Test
Show someone the section for 5 seconds. Ask: "What is this?" and "How did it make you feel?"

**Pass if:** They describe it accurately and use words like "calm," "elegant," "inviting."
**Fail if:** They're confused or use words like "busy," "sales-y," "generic."

### The Squint Test
Squint at the screen until you can't read text. Look at shapes and contrast.

**Pass if:** Clear hierarchy, balanced composition, breathing room.
**Fail if:** Too many competing elements, cluttered, no focal point.

### The "Template" Test
Could this section exist on a Squarespace/Wix template?

**Pass if:** No — it feels custom, specific, considered.
**Fail if:** Yes — it follows a generic pattern.

### The "Startup Landing Page" Test
Does this feel like it's trying to convert me?

**Pass if:** No — it feels like an invitation, a space to enter.
**Fail if:** Yes — it feels like a funnel.

### The Brand Alignment Test
Does this feel like it could be from Kinfolk/The Gentlewoman/Aesop?

**Pass if:** Yes — same energy, same restraint, same confidence.
**Fail if:** No — feels like a different brand entirely.

## 8. Exception Process

If a decision conflicts with these guardrails:

1. **Stop** — do not implement
2. **Document** — what is the conflict?
3. **Justify** — why is the exception necessary?
4. **Review** — get explicit approval
5. **Minimize** — if approved, execute with maximum restraint

No exceptions are approved by default. The burden of proof is on the exception.

*Document version: 1.1*
*Status: Approved — Ready for implementation*
