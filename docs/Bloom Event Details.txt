If your life looks fine but feels wrong…”

Hook (0–2s): “If your life looks fine but feels wrong… that’s not drama. That’s a signal.”
Opposite-side nod: “I know. You’re grateful. You’re functioning. You’re doing what you should.”
Core: “But sometimes ‘fine’ is just the version of you that learned to survive quietly.”
Scene: Car/window/tea. “Nothing was falling apart… but I felt like I was disappearing inside my own life.”
Emotional turn: “That season isn’t failure. It’s your next chapter trying to find you.”
CTA: “Comment BLOOM and I’ll DM you the first invite.”
I want to shoot this script but its too scetchy. Pls make it conversational cause its a video meaning its a talking script not a reading script 
The 1st script is still not sitting well with me. Let the script be in a Lisa Nichols style, 
“The way I like to do videos, especially short videos, is I like to talk about my experience and then let the audience bring them in, invite them like, okay, this is where I used to be, this is what happens to me, and then if you are in this phase, this is what it means, and then I give them a cause of action. For example, about outgrowing spaces or becoming, I can say a quote, maybe from Lisa Nichols or Wayne Dyer. Wayne Dyer always says,”

“Just a minute, listen. So for example, when they always say that, that, that, that, that, and I, there was a time I felt like this, this, this, and it made me this, this, this. So if you are in this stage, I want you to know that it's not this, this, this, it's this, this, so, and then you give a call to action. So it's not me talking to them or at them, I'm talking about myself and then letting them see a reflection of their stories in mine, and then putting all of us on a clean field. So I'm not saying, imagine you this, imagine you that, do you this, do you that, it just makes me feel like I'm starting outside talking to them or talking at them, but it should be like I'm talking about something that happened to me and then bringing them in, I don't know if it makes sense.”

I want this script to be heavily guided by the law of polarity
I want this script to be heavily guided by the law of polarity:

Hook: “Hot take: healing isn’t private. It’s communal.”
Opposite-side nod: “Yes, therapy matters. Journaling matters. Solitude matters.”
Core: “But being witnessed by safe women? That changes your bones.”
Scene: Empty chair/table shot. “Most women carry everything alone and call it ‘strength.’”
Emotional turn: “Strength isn’t isolation. Strength is letting yourself be supported.”
CTA: “Comment THRIVE if you want the room.”
Text beats: communal → witnessed → supported → THRIVE

can you start the script with “Strength isn’t isolation”

Script 3 — “Stop waiting to feel ready.”

Hook: “Ready isn’t a feeling. Ready is a decision.”
Opposite-side nod: “I get it. You want certainty before you commit.”
Core: “But confidence isn’t a prerequisite. It’s a byproduct.”
Scene: Mirror-getting-ready shot. “I’ve never felt ready before a growth moment. I’ve only felt called.”
Emotional turn: “You don’t need to be fearless. You need to be honest.”
CTA: “Comment BLOOM for the invite list.”
Text beats: ready → decision → confidence → byproduct

“I want this script to be heavily guided by the law of polarity” Script 3 (Jan 16): “Stop waiting to feel ready.”

Hook:
“You’re waiting to feel ready? That’s the trap.”

Opposite-side nod:
“I get it. You don’t want to waste time, money, energy. You want certainty.”

Core argument:
“But confidence isn’t a prerequisite. It’s a byproduct of choosing yourself.”

Scene:
Mirror shot, getting ready.
“I’ve never once felt ready before a big growth moment. I’ve only felt called.”

Emotional turn:
“You don’t need to be fearless. You need to be honest.”

CTA:
“Comment BLOOM if you want the room that helps you start.”

Text beats: ready is a trap → confidence is a byproduct → choose yourself → BLOOM
Another one
If you're feeling lost, maybe it's because your soul is leading you away from where you no longer belong.” Pls do an Instagram post caption, I used the above on a photo 
Option 3
I didn’t understand this well:

Weekend Stories (Sat 17 + Sun 18):
Poll: “Where are you craving a new chapter?” (Self / Love / Career / Motherhood / Friendships)
Q box: “What are you outgrowing?”
What story can I post today Sunday 18?
What caption can I put under this static quote style post and also how can I make this more interesting:

A lot of women aren’t “lazy.” They’re exhausted from living a life that doesn’t fit anymore.
If that’s you… you’re not alone. 🌸
